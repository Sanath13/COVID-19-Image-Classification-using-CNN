Classification of Chest Radiographs for Detection of COVID-19 Using Convolutional Neural Networks.

In this repository, I have built a Convolutional Neural Network model to classify chest radiographs into COVID-19, Normal/Healthy and Viral Pneumonia classes.

A publicly available dataset has been taken for training of the model. You can download the dataset from the link below:

I have taken 800 images of each class as training dataset, 200 images of each class as validation dataset, and 200 images of each class as testing dataset.
